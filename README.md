# 5-Year-Harvest-Plan-for-Honey-Prawn-OR

#INTRODUCTION

##Purpose

The purpose of this report is to provide Deluxe Seafoods Ltd. a 5-year harvest plan for the honey-prawn stocks in each of the 5 zones across the 5-years. This plan is to be optimal with respect to the net present value of the operation. 

In addition, a case for the procurement of an 11th vessel will be investigated. As such, an alternative NPV-optimal harvest plan for a fleet of 11 vessels will also be devised.  

##Method

The information used in this report is provided by Deluxe Seafoods Ltd., the Haruchai Government and the Haruchai Department of Primary Industries. This information was used to create the generalised mixed integer programming model for the NPV-optimal harvest plan to aid in the decision making for the upcoming 5 years. 


#FINDINGS


The net present value of the base case was determined to be: $20,654,241.80. The vessel allocation and amounts of honey prawns to be harvested from each zone can be seen from the NPV-optimal harvest plan attached below.

For the alternative case, it was found that the procurement of an 11th vessel would benefit Deluxe Seafoods. In other words, it is advisable to purchase an additional vessel because in case of buying a new vessel would increase to total NPV to 21,012,020.99 . This is because the one-off capital expenditure (CAPEX) of the 11th vessel is not high enough and we are able to harvest more thanks to 11th vessel without passing the harvesting limits. 

Therefore, if Deluxe Seafoods wish to increase profits hence increase harvest, the procurement of the 11th vessel should be approved.
